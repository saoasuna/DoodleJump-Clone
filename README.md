# DoodleJump-Clone
DoodleJump Clone
Doodlejump Clone is an imitation of the popular mobile platforming game, built using the Tiva C Launchpad (microcontroller kit) and Orbit Booster Pack. Much like the original game, the character sprite is controlled through accelerometer input. The graphics are constantly updated on the Orbit Booster Packâ€™s OLED screen, and high scores are saved to the EEPROM. A morse code translator has also been implemented through using UART and PuTTY. The onboard lights can be controlled with the potentiometer.
